Introduction "
Lean has lots of tactics, and sometimes students learn about tactics which
they want to learn in the Filter Game but *can't use* because they
haven't been introduced yet.

In MinMax World we have levels which introduce new tactics. The more
you do, the more \"power\" you will have available to you.
